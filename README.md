Ansible SBT
=========

This roles install SBT in debian based distributions.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: mpathira.sbt }
